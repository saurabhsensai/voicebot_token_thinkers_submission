What is P2P lending?,"

P2P (Peer-to-Peer) lending is a financial service that connects individual lenders and borrowers directly, without involving traditional banks. It operates through online platforms that act as intermediaries, handling the loan process, credit assessment, and repayment collection. This system allows individuals to lend money to others and borrowers to access funds, especially those who might have difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks.





For investors, P2P lending is considered a high-risk, high-return alternative investment that can provide portfolio diversification. However, it's important to note that these investments are not liquid, and there are risks involved, such as potential loan defaults during economic downturns.
