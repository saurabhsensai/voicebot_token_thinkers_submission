What are the benefits of P2P lending?,"

P2P lending offers several attractive benefits for investors:

1. Competitive returns: You can potentially earn high annual returns by investing in unsecured personal loans.
2. Portfolio diversification: It serves as a high-risk/high-return alternative investment, helping to diversify your overall portfolio.
3. Non-market linked: P2P lending isn't directly tied to market fluctuations, offering a different investment avenue.

However, it's important to be aware that P2P lending also comes with risks such as liquidity constraints, default risk, and economic sensitivity. It's crucial to carefully consider these factors and manage risks when engaging in P2P lending.

How secure is P2P lending?,"

P2P lending on LendenClub incorporates several security measures to protect both lenders and borrowers. These include an Escrow Mechanism managed by ICICI Trusteeship Services Ltd, ensuring separate bank accounts for lender and borrower funds. We also practice transparent fund management, returning all funds to respective accounts within the next business day. Additionally, our capital matching algorithm helps diversify lending to mitigate credit default risk.






However, it's important to understand that P2P lending still carries inherent risks. These include credit default risk, collection risk in case of defaults, and no guaranteed returns. While LendenClub is an RBI-registered NBFC-P2P, potential lenders should be aware that they may face partial or full loss of principal and/or interest on their investments. We always encourage our users to carefully consider these factors before participating in P2P lending.
